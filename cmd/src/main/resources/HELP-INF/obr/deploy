Usage: obr:deploy [options] <bundle-name | bundle-symbolic-name>[@<version>] | <bundle-id> ...

Tries to install or update the specified bundles and all of their dependencies
by default.  Either the bundle name/symbolic-name or the bundle identifier can
be specified.  If a bundle's name contains spaces, then it must be surrounded
by quotes.  It is also possible to specify a precise version if more than one
version exists.

options:

    -s, --start                 start the deployed bundles

    -ro, --requiredonly         deploy the required bundles only

    -f, --force					uninstall those having the same names as the
                                specified bundles and all of their dependencies
                                first, and then deploy
